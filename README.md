# Customer-Segmentation
Nexus Bank is a financial institution dedicated to delivering unparalleled banking services to her clients.Her mission is to establish enduring relationships with the customers by providing tailored financial solutions that align with individual needs and goals.
PROBLEM STATEMENT: To Identify patterns and trends in customer behavior to decipher if customer demographics such as age, educational level e.t.c influences customers attitude toward defaulting and also too anticipate the likelihood of subscription to term deposits from customers.

The methodology used in this case study involves the following steps:

Data cleaning and preprocessing: The first step is to clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values,
removing outliers, and transforming variables as necessary.

Exploratory data analysis: Next, i performed an exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data, such as identifying trends and patterns, and identifying correlations between variables.

Feature engineering: Based on the insights gained from the exploratory data analysis, feature engineering was performed to select the most relevant features for predicting customers who defaulted and those most likely to subscribe to term-deposit and transform them as necessary.

Encode categorical variables: Here the categorical variables are converted into numerical representations that machine learning algorithms can process. Common encoding techniques used in this project is one-hot encoding.

Data Spliting: The dataset was divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Scale/Normalize numerical variables: I scaled/normalized the numerical variables in the dataset to ensure they are on a similar scale. This step helps prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the model training process. I used the normalization (scaling to a specific range) technique.

Train the model: The machine learning model was fit into the training data.

Model selection and training: We will then select a suitable machine learning algorithm for predicting heart diseases, such as logistic regression, a decision tree, and other model will be trained on the preprocessed data.

Evaluate the model: I used the testing data to assess the model's performance, such as calculating accuracy, precision, recall, or other evaluation metrics.

The best model will be selected and recommended for use.
